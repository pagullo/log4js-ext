# Installation #

To install log4js-ext, download it from http://code.google.com/p/log4js-ext/downloads/list.

The download includes a **log4js-ext-source-javascript-x.y.zip** file, with all javascript source code, and a **log4js-remoting-x.y.jar** file that supports remote logging to Java web apps.

To start using log4js-ext in the client side, you will want to include the **log4js-ext-all.js** file.

If you use the built-in log viewer, you will want to include the CSS file defining several styles, **log4js-ext-all-dev.css**, and a pair of auxiliary files, both provided by ExtJs, **StatusBar.js** and **RowExpander.js**.

To see all of this in action, take a look at the content of the **sm/log/examples** directory.
